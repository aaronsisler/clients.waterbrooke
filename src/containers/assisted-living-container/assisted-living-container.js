    At Brookdale we offer much more than a place to stay — we offer a place to
    live well. Our residents share some common values: to be recognized as
    individuals, to lead lives with a sense of purpose, and to maintain
    connections with people and interests that are meaningful to them. Because
    we’re passionate about enabling those values, we are constantly innovating
    new and better ways for enriching the lives of our senior living residents.
