        Life in a memory care community
      </h2>
      <p>
        Many people have misconceptions about what life is like at a memory care
        community. They think it might be a sad or lonely environment. But in
        reality, many of the residents who live in our memory care communities
        have a full and rich life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to having access to quality care, they get to spend their
        days surrounded by kind and compassionate care team members, a community
        of interesting residents and fun-filled activities that help them
        continue to live with purpose and meaning.
