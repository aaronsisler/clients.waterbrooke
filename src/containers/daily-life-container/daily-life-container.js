      Life at Waterbrooke is designed to encourage our residents to stay
      involved in social activities, physically active as they are able, and
      connected to the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strive to bring your loved one's interests to life through programs and
      outings that reflect their talents and personalities, while also offering
      new experiences that will challenge them and keep them mentally healthy.
      From wellness programs to cultural and social events, there are
      opportunities for everyone to be involved.

    <p>
      Many of our amenities are what enable our residents to feel truly at home,
      including home-style cooking and even private event rooms for friendly
      get-togethers and celebrating family traditions.
